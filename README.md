# Admin-Panel
Material AdminLTE Template setup

This is an Admin Panel setup for local projects. I have sorted the header and footer parts. Also in the pages folder there are forms, buttons and all UI elements which are required to work. Just clone the repo and add the admin folder into your project directory and start using the admin panel easily.
